# Data Mining Experiments using WEKA

This repository contains data mining experiments performed using the WEKA tool.
The objective is to understand how classical machine learning algorithms work
on real-world datasets without coding.

## Tools Used
- WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis)

## Dataset
- **German Credit Risk Dataset**
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Task: Credit risk classification (Good / Bad credit)

## Experiments Performed

### 1. Decision Tree
- Algorithm: J48 (C4.5)
- Purpose: To understand decision rules and feature splits
- Observation: The model provides interpretable rules for credit approval

### 2. Feature Ranking
- Method: Attribute evaluator with ranker
- Purpose: Identify most influential features affecting credit risk

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Kernel-based classification
- Used to compare performance with decision tree

## Results
- Decision Tree gave interpretable rules
- SVM showed competitive accuracy
- Feature ranking helped understand key risk attributes

## Key Learnings
- Understood supervised learning using WEKA
- Learned model comparison without programming
- Gained experience in data preprocessing and evaluation
